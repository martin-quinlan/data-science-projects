**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Example of delivery time prediction implementation
class DeliveryPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor(
            n_estimators=100,
            max_depth=10,
            random_state=42
        )
        
    def preprocess_features(self, data):
        # Feature engineering implementation
        return processed_features
        
    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(self.preprocess_features(X), y)
```
